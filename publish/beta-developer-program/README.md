Beta OS access enables developers to test their channels for bugs before Roku OS is released to customers, ensuring your channel is properly optimized for the update when it launches. Developers in the program improve the Roku Platform by reporting bugs and making feature requests, which directly helps the Roku team prioritize our resources.

## How it works

To be a part of the Roku Beta Developer Program, [activate a Roku Testing Portal account](https://rokutestingportal.centercode.com/callout/?callid=C3D70CF78CBB41C5906C7838A41F24BE) and complete the following application. If approved, developers will begin receiving beta OS builds within a few days of registering their first Roku device.

Approved participants in the Roku Beta Developer Program can:

* **Register Roku devices** - The program provides specific devices with access to the latest OS versions
* **Register channels** - Let Roku know which channels you own or have built for clients
* **File bug reports** - Be the first to spot regressions and bugs before your customers
* **Send feature requests** - We are open to features and tools you think will help grow your audience
* **Join discussion board** - Participate in this secure forum for beta developers to ask questions and share tips
* **Test developer tools** - In addition to Roku OS, we also use the program to release early versions of new developer tools that aid in channel development

## Confidentiality

Approved developers are asked to sign a Nondisclosure Agreement before joining the program. The Roku OS beta releases, tools, and discussions related to the program are all confidential and may not be discussed outside of the Roku Testing Portal — neither in person nor online.
